                        I start doing competitive programming since high school. I received a Bronze Medal in National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) in 2015. Then I joined the Competitive Programming Team of Zhejiang University and competed as the team leader of Team Legilimens (2017-2019) and the student co-coach (2018-2021). During my undergraduate life, I won 12 gold medals in International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), China Collegiate Programming Contest (CCPC) series competitions including the very first domestic ICPC Regional Champion of Zhejiang University in 2017. On behalf of Zhejiang University, I participated in ICPC World Finals 2018 (Beijing).
